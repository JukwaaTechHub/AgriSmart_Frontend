## How to Contribute

Welcome! We’re excited to have you contribute to this project. Here’s a detailed guide to help you get started and contribute effectively:

- **Forking** means making a personal copy of this repository to your own GitHub account.  
  - Go to the project GitHub page and click the **Fork** button (top right).  
  - This lets you freely make changes without affecting the original repository.  
- Alternatively, if you already have write access or want to work directly on the project, you can **clone** the original repository to your local machine without forking.


### 2. Clone Your Fork or the Original Repo Locally

- After forking, go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the **Code** button to copy the HTTPS URL.  
- Open your terminal or Git Bash and run:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/html-collab-project.git


### 3. Create a New Branch for Your Work

- Switch to a new branch with a descriptive name related to the changes you want to make:  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-add-footer


### 4. Make Your Changes

- Open the project files in your favorite code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).  


### 5. Commit Your Changes

- Stage the files you want to include in your commit by running:  
  ```bash
  git add .

- Commit the changes with a meaningful and concise message describing what you did:  
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add footer section with contact info"


### 6. Push Your Branch to GitHub

- Push your branch to your remote fork on GitHub:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature-add-footer
